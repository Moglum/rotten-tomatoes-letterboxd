Everything from Eva's battle scene, to Tokyo III turning on its solar pannels, trucks driving along the intertwined roads, and the battles against the Angel's are breathtaking. I would compare the art to the recent \"Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse\" or the recent \"Dragon Ball Super: Broly\".\n\nYou can tell that everyone involved wanted to be as creative as possible and not having any repetition or fillers. Every single Angel is unique in a completely different way and the level of creativity to think of these is not something I can conceptualize. About 20 minute into the movie, there was an amazing 5-minute fight sequence, and then the story progressed to a lot of other interesting bits. I think a typical film would have used those 5 minutes as the climax of an otherwise \"filled-in\" 2-hour feature film.\n\nThe characters and plot are both fun but also really deep. As the plot evolves, you can tell there are a lot of Christian undertones, and the concept of Angels, God and human meaning begins to really take the front stage. At the same time, there is a lot of comic relief related to penguins, nudes and sexual insinuations.\n\nOverall, this film is a 5/5 for me on every single front and I can't wait to keep watching the series.", "hasReview": true}, "media": {"audienceScore": {"score": "89", "sentiment": "positive"}, "emsId": "f8c0bdfe-96cc-3ad5-921e-4eb51bf1189a", "pageLink": "/m/evangelion_222_you_can_not_advance", "posterUrl": "https://resizing.flixster.com/gbBXTkyWssuYBIakDXQWeylb0K8=/206x305/v2/https://flxt.tmsimg.com/assets/p8058959_p_v8_aa.jpg", "primaryVideo": {"exists": false, "emsId": "f8c0bdfe-96cc-3ad5-921e-4eb51bf1189a", "type": "Movie"}, "title": "Evangelion: 2.22 You Can (Not) Advance", "tomatometerScore": {"certified": false, "score": "82", "sentiment": "positive"}, "type": "Movie"}}, {"createTime": 1624117992529, "review": {"score": 4, "review": "A very entraining look into the rise and fall (and maybe risk again?) of WeWork.

This often means some sort of small iteration on an existing idea or product with a killer feature that brings mass adoption. The unfortunate truth is that mass adoption is the only way a company or product can survive, regardless of how cool the tech is, or how passionate the engineers are behind it. In addition, profitability is something that must also come sooner or later depending on the business. This film is a testament to that fact.\n\n\n\\n\\nAmazon started of as book store with an edge, Google started of as a better search engine, Facebook started of as another social network with a better approach to user acquisition, etc\u2026 While Amazon wanted to eventually be your point of sale for everything in your home, and Google wanted to organize the world's data, and Facebook wanted to connect every person in the world, they started off with practical targets but ambitious goals. General Magic had ambitious goals and ambitious targets, which ultimately led to it's fall\u2026\n\n\n\\n\\nOne of the things that saddened me the most throughout this movie is the lack of Marc Porat's \"second coming\". The film depicted him as a visionary, a good leader, a charismatic speaker, and much more. This failure seemed to have really stung him so deep that he was unable to go back on the big stage again. In addition, after reading \"Valley of Genius\" by Adam Fisher, I was really looking forward to seeing what Andy Rubin's role and contribution at General Magic was, but it seems that he did not want to be part of the film.\n\n\n\\n\\nA lot of successful engineers speak of how they simply like to \"tinker with things\" and \"follow their passion\". Tony Fadell is the most classic example of how true and false that is. He desperately wanted to join and contribute to the company even though he was a lot less qualified than everyone else. He followed his passion, he tinkered with things, and learnt a lot in the meantime. However, towards the end of the film, he briefly speaks about a business plan he came up with (which was rejected) about how to bring a simpler, but cheaper, product to the market in a shorter period of time. He ultimately brings his experience and mindset back to Apple to release the iPhone, iPod and achieve great success. This shows the fine balance and tradeoffs that need to be made between passion and success. This also questions Peter Thiel's thesis of \"Zero To One\". Arguably, General Magic was trying to make that leap, but while the leap from 0 to 1 wouldn't been impressive, the leap from 0 to 0.1 would have had the same magnitude.\n\n\n\\n\\nAt the time of writing this review, I've been at Magic Leap for about three years. If I had a nickel for every moment I wanted to say \"this is just like Magic Leap\",  I would probably have a few dollars by the end of the film. Most notably, I kept asking myself what the Magic Link was actually useful for at the time. Similarly, a lot of people ask me what the Magic Leap can be used for. There are a few basic use cases, with some very intriguing first party content, but both products are just very expensive proof of concepts that are paving the path forward. The flipping coin in the Magic Link was cool, as are the floating islands in the Magic Leap boot up sequence, but is it really necessary?

I watched it with my family in two parts (1 hour each) over a span of two nights. On the second day, my family and I went on a small day trip to Niagra Falls which is about a 2 hour drive away. We like to listen to podcasts, interviews or audiobooks on long trips, so during the drive back we decided to listen to one of Vladimir Pozner's latest talks. By chance it was about the freedom of speech and the role of journalism in democracy. This fit in extremely well with the premise of the film as the two really complimented each other. The fact that we watched the film in two parts and listen to Pozner's talk in between could not have worked out any better.

While I'm not Emma Stone's biggest fan, I love and admire her acting ability. As a lover of musicals, I was very pleasantly surprised 1 minute into the movie when I found out it was also a musical! The music was great, the story was lovely and the camera angles and transitions were both fun and original. \n\nI don't think my review can do the movie justice because the number of golden globe awards it's winning (as I'm writing this), and the review by Chris Hartwell (in The Hart Beat) speaks for itself.\n\nThe reason for the missing star is because the dancing and singing of the two main actors was good but not exactly \"broadway\" level.

All three movies are composed of very few long shots. I think this one could be boiled down to less than half a dozen scenes in total, where every one tells a completely different story and shows a different side of these lovable characters.\n\nThe scene where they were driving just shows a couple that's been together for a little while having fun, driving around, reminiscing, and just enjoying the moment. The scene where Jesse discusses his idea for the next book gives a look into what kind of person he is and what he does for a living. It only took two decades, but we see how an individual's career is ever changing and doesn't have predetermine achievable milestones. The lunch table scene was probably my favorite. It was a conversation that touched on physical attraction, emotional connection, young love, loved that transcends death, the rise of AI in computing technology, literature and so much more. Set in a beautiful atmosphere where I would love to spend a summer, it was a group of individuals I would have loved to dine with. The scene where they walked through the city gave me hope. It showed that relationships aren't so bad if you put a bit of effort into them. However, the last scene ruined it all. It was tough to watch and hit really close to home, where a lot of the debates are ones I've seen myself growing up.\n\nI love that the tone and the characters remain the same but the themes change. It shows that we, as people, never really change, but it is only what we're concerned with around us that's mutable. Our view and perspective of the world may develop and become more well grounded, but for the most part it is still the same. Jesse was a horny teenager in 1994, 2003 and 2012. At first he had no worries and no plans, then he had a bad marriage with a kid and a best seller, and eventually he moved on to two marriages, established as an author, but still a horny teenager. Celine was always a crazy political feminist/activist, and nothing changed. The only difference is that she simply had more responsibilities and shit to deal with after the twins were born. \n\nIf not for the very last scene, I'd have a very difficult time letting go of the movie, but it's relieving to see that they found a way to reconnect and reignite the flame of passion from almost two decades ago.
