It's a shame Legasov did not live the impact of his heroism, and how he is celebrated and seen in modern culture.\n\nI'm going to assume that the show is mostly true to reality, but if it's not, it does not take away from the brutal, but beautifully told, 5 episode story that was told. \n\nIt really portrayed how everyone in the USSR saw themselves as members of the state, and they dedicated their whole livelihoods to the state. People risked their lives for a few hundred rubles, which was no more than a few months of pay. I later learned from my parents that scientists and engineers had a monthly stipend of 120 rubles a month, whereas those doing physical labour earned upwards of 400 rubles a month. For comparison, University professors were only earning 300 rubles a month at most. Overall though, I could not believe the level of corruption that existed in the USSR, and how worthless human lives really were...\n\nI don't know how accurate the science was, but I loved the level and quantity of details provided. This series without any scientific context would have definitely been insufficient, but I also was not looking for a 5 hour science lesson. The directors did a great job at integrating a very proper amount of \"science\" into the show.\n\nA combination of the actors and cinematography really managed to sway my emotions as the directors had probably hoped. Seeing the boy soldier go from barely being able to shoot a dog to killing dozens a day made me challenge question of how desensitized I would be in that situation. Seeing Khomyuk convince Legasov to tell the truth about AZ-5 made me question how I would've behaved in that situation. Seeing Gorbachev made me both fear and respect him at the same time. \n\nA few of my favourite scenes were the slow-motion groups of people who enjoyed viewing the \"beautiful\" explosion, not knowing that they were soaking tons of radiation and bound to die in the very near future.", "hasReview": true}, "media": {"audienceScore": {"score": "97", "sentiment": "positive"}, "emsId": "8a89a5a8-e23e-317b-a109-46eb053a0845", "pageLink": "/tv/chernobyl/s01", "posterUrl": "https://resizing.flixster.com/PE2ZJ4pv8wCjuZ9LvektTlh5lHE=/206x305/v2/https://flxt.tmsimg.com/assets/p16695117_b_v10_ae.jpg", "primaryVideo": {"exists": false, "emsId": "8a89a5a8-e23e-317b-a109-46eb053a0845", "type": "TvSeason"}, "title": "Chernobyl: Miniseries", "tomatometerScore": {"certified": true, "score": "95", "sentiment": "positive"}, "type": "TvSeason"}}, {"createTime": 1561211529291, "review": {"score": 4, "hasReview": false}, "media": {"audienceScore": {"score": "93", "sentiment": "positive"}, "emsId": "9b2a86f1-438f-3d83-adf1-463bbd6cb7de", "pageLink": "/tv/friends/s07", "posterUrl": "https://resizing.flixster.com/1d8NKuNz3WbgIJoHUYfaQJIGiis=/206x305/v2/https://flxt.tmsimg.com/assets/p7892579_b_v8_ah.jpg", "primaryVideo": {"exists": false, "emsId": "9b2a86f1-438f-3d83-adf1-463bbd6cb7de", "type": "TvSeason"}, "title": "Friends: Season 7", "tomatometerScore": {}, "type": "TvSeason"}}, {"createTime": 1561211199377, "review": {"score": 4, "hasReview": false}, "media": {"audienceScore": {"score": "94", "sentiment": "positive"}, "emsId": "85ce5f8a-7090-37ef-8aba-8135d666a440", "pageLink": "/tv/friends/s06", "posterUrl": "https://resizing.flixster.com/Yx2EunJoJPQUDE81dZQz5YRy_9M=/206x305/v2/https://flxt.tmsimg.com/assets/p7892601_b_v8_av.jpg", "primaryVideo": {"exists": false, "emsId": "85ce5f8a-7090-37ef-8aba-8135d666a440", "type": "TvSeason"}, "title": "Friends: Season 6", "tomatometerScore": {"certified": false, "score": "100", "sentiment": "positive"}, "type": "TvSeason"}}, {"createTime": 1543647968000, "review": {"score": 5, "hasReview": false}, "media": {"audienceScore": {"score": "95", "sentiment": "positive"}, "emsId": "09bd32e2-3281-3799-b602-7084ec61da8b", "pageLink": "/tv/friends/s02", "posterUrl": "https://resizing.flixster.com/mwECKn2EbLS-LmwnxcjZhGofLzg=/206x305/v2/https://flxt.tmsimg.com/assets/p7892599_b_v8_ab.jpg", "primaryVideo": {"exists": false, "emsId": "09bd32e2-3281-3799-b602-7084ec61da8b", "type": "TvSeason"}, "title": "Friends: Season 2", "tomatometerScore": {}, "type": "TvSeason"}}, {"createTime": 1543647159000, "review": {"score": 5, "review": "One of the most underrated shows on TV.

Even though there is an individual plot that everyone is facing, the transition to/from the overarching shared plot is very smooth and unforced. There are no fillers, superfluous fight scenes or unnecessary sex scenes; everything has a meaning.\n\nThe cinematography is out of this world. Ranging from slow beautiful scenic scenes to action filled hand-to-hand combat or bar shootouts, to exotic and emotional orgies, that I never wanted to take my eyes off the screen.\n\nIt's unfortunate that the show was cancelled after Season 2, but I loved every minute of the first two seasons.", "hasReview": true}, "media": {"audienceScore": {"score": "90", "sentiment": "positive"}, "emsId": "97b21cf8-df62-3526-844b-708e169b9036", "pageLink": "/tv/sense8/s02", "posterUrl": "https://resizing.flixster.com/qcrgmVIL2QaEYjtxLj3_AUfQaOw=/206x305/v2/https://flxt.tmsimg.com/assets/p13579391_b_v13_aa.jpg", "primaryVideo": {"exists": false, "emsId": "97b21cf8-df62-3526-844b-708e169b9036", "type": "TvSeason"}, "title": "Sense8: Season 2", "tomatometerScore": {"certified": true, "score": "93", "sentiment": "positive"}, "type": "TvSeason"}}, {"createTime": 1503865868000, "review": {"score": 5, "review": "If I could give this season more than 6 stars, I would.

The fact that this was mostly based on a true story is also amazing in a whole nother way. Solid episode.\n\nRest of the episodes\n---------------------------\nThat was quite the ride!

Wow. Fuck. What the hell. Omg. Umm. Speechless.\n\nIt?s a little bit saddening to say that the best episode of the series is the one where key characters die, but making a decision like this is difficult for the directors, writers, actors and everyone else involved. The acting was amazing. Every pease of dialogue served purpose. The smirk on Nigan?s face was priceless and just so appropriately perfect. The flashbacks, the music, the lighting, the crying, the splatter. This episode simply blew my mind and opened my eyes, no pun intended. \n\nEpisode 2\n?????\nWhile this episode definitely can?t top the previous one, it was nonetheless amazing. The mood the walking dead adapted over the last couple season has been a game changer and reinvigorated my interested in the show.\n\nAfter the prison I was really curious where the show was going. You can only do the whole ?settle down, get attacked, lose your city, move on? thing so many times and it started getting old. Playing sim city is also not the exact reason why I watch the show. I?m really impressed but the new world the writers have created, and the concept of Negan as a whole. I?m curious to see where it goes.\n\nIf the first two episodes are at all a signal of how the rest of the season will pan out, there are a lot of exciting things ahead!\n\nEpisode 3\n????-\nThe great thing is the balance the team creating the show has found between separating their lead characters, following multiple story lines, but maintaining a sense of cohesiveness. I know that all the story lines will converge together at some point, but simultaneously I feel like I?m getting a flavor of many different elements of the world they?re living in.\n\nEpisode 4\n?????\nAfter so many seasons, this is the first time the show has manage to build up some real tension.\n\nHaving developed such a close relationship with the characters, I almost want to cry out and help rick. I want to support him and tell him everything will be okay. I want to tell him that I have faith. I just want him to beat Negan with Luccille. However, I?m afraid of Negan. I?m afraid he?ll kill me if I do anything. Even worse, I?m afraid he might have me start chopping off my friend?s body parts, and then eat them or something.??Years of watching this show has set me up to be all the more engaged in what is otherwise just plain dialogue. If this were the first show anyone watched, they would think that it?s plain and boring. The zombies are weak and posing no threat. The lead characters are abiding and don?t take action. However, it is the relationship that the writers had us built with Rick that makes it so powerful. The whole episode, I continuously felt frustrated, heartbroken and powerful. I didn?t know what to do other than simply concede.\n\nI really really hope they?ll find a way out of this one because I feel like crawling into a corner and crying as I watch every episode.\n\nEpisode 5\n-------------\nA somewhat slower episode relative to what's been happening before, but I'm glad to take a little beat of a breather. This episode was setting things up for a very climactic meeting with Negan in the near future that I simply cannot wait for. In the meantime, Maggie's leadership skills are shining and foreshadowing her potentially coming into power at some point. How awesome would that be?\n\nEpisode 6\n-------------\nWell, not every one is a winner... Tara is just a character I don't really care about and I don't think the actor is that great either. She tries to be this young, free, easygoing gay chick, but I get absolutely no sense of what she tries to achieve. This episode was meant to show her losing a friend, keeping a secret, going on an adventure on her own for the very first time. It felt awkward, cringy and very forced throughout. Probably one of my least favorite episodes of The Walking Dead in a very long time.\n\nEpisode 7\n--------------\nThis episode is all about Negan. He's a brilliant character and probably the scariest villan The Walking Dead has had so far. He is the most powerful, the most unexpected and is able to create this false sense of security that he shatters within moment. In other words, he's a psychopath. I also have to give credit to Jeffrey Dean Morgan, because he seems to be the perfect fit for the role and puts up a flawless performance. On a different note, I really want to know what will happen to Rick and Carl!\n\nEpisode 8\n-------------\nTo be completely honest, Negan is pretty reasonable in his own way. He didn't kill Carl or Rosita, he follows through with what he says, and he makes sure everything is in tact. He is quite crazy, but reasonable in his own way as well. It's his way or the highway, but his way is very well defined. That being said, I can't wait for him to die and see what the Saviors will do when they no longer have a leader. As cheesy as the last scene was, I loved it because I really do feel like I'm part of the family. Great mid season finale :)\n\nEpisode 9\n-------------\nI'm so excited to see this show back again! All I can think about now is how Rick is going to take on the saviours, and there are lots of very interesting alternatives that are coming up!\n\nEpisode 10\n---------------\nThe bits of action were short but very impactful. While there isn't much character development, this episode brought along a large change in attitude in a fair portion of the cast. Things are moving slowly, but are coming together. I can't wait for the great finale.\n\nEpisode 11\n---------------\nLoved this episode! A full episode of just Eugene being smarty pants. I love his transformation, and simply enjoy listening to him talk as I sit on the roller coaster of emotions from fear, to cowardliness, to greed and power. He is one of the most unpredictable characters on the show in my opinion and I can't wait to see what's next for him.\n\nEpisode 12\n---------------\nA whole episode of just love, hope, fear and fighting. Not much to say but it was beautiful in it's own way.\n\nEpisode 13\n---------------\nI was really looking forward to seeing what that kid could make out of himself, so I'm sad to his him go. That being said, Morgan and Carol are finally back on the boat. The final battle can't come soon enough!\n\nEpisode 14\n---------------\nThis was another great episode covering how another set of characters has developed in recent past. That being said, regardless of how good the storyline is, all TWWD fans are waiting for one thing: the final battle!\n\nEpisode 15\n-------------\nSolid overall season. While the second half was not as exciting as the first, a lot has happened. We're no longer just stuck in the prison, but the world is actually changing. Alliances are forming, leaders are disappearing, new leaders are forming and a war is on the brink. Main characters died, others took a hundred and eighty degree turn in their personalities, and what I'd expect out of a post-apocalyptic world really did happen. The turn of events in the season finale really took me by surprise and am really impressed by it.", "hasReview": true}, "media": {"audienceScore": {"score": "60", "sentiment": "positive"}, "emsId": "81d99671-9f33-3ac5-a4fd-7d3fd2ae1b52", "pageLink": "/tv/the_walking_dead/s07", "posterUrl": "https://resizing.flixster.com/6BrEGKxKpoYN0gvNu3aMqC8lRWo=/206x305/v2/https://flxt.tmsimg.com/assets/p13176393_b_v8_ab.jpg", "primaryVideo": {"exists": false, "emsId": "81d99671-9f33-3ac5-a4fd-7d3fd2ae1b52", "type": "TvSeason"}, "title": "The Walking Dead: Season 7", "tomatometerScore": {"certified": false, "score": "66", "sentiment": "positive"}, "type": "TvSeason"}}, {"createTime": 1472933898000, "review": {"score": 4, "hasReview": false}, "media": {"audienceScore": {"score": "93", "sentiment": "positive"}, "emsId": "23989a5c-72c2-3a30-9b87-1dd5f70589b9", "pageLink": "/tv/halt_and_catch_fire/s01", "posterUrl": "https://resizing.flixster.com/LwtMl0kcjzn4mi5yCD_TXDYIFsA=/206x305/v2/https://resizing.flixster.com/XlfAXx049pHyDKWlk9jQI_uqZus=/ems.cHJkLWVtcy1hc3NldHMvdHZzZWFzb24vUlRUVjExMTgzOS53ZWJw", "primaryVideo": {"exists": false, "emsId": "23989a5c-72c2-3a30-9b87-1dd5f70589b9", "type": "TvSeason"}, "title": "Halt and Catch Fire: Season 1", "tomatometerScore": {"certified": true, "score": "76", "sentiment": "positive"}, "type": "TvSeason"}}, {"createTime": 1468790928000, "review": {"score": 5, "review": "Episode 1\n-------------\n\nReally glad to see that the show has returned! The tone has really changed since the first season. Elliot has no trouble breaking the fourth wall anymore, and not only narrates, but has even developed a slight vendetta towards the audience for not warning him in the first season. He has also turned into a complete schizophrenic. While he is aware of his condition, he doesn't seem open to external help or mediation. He believes that a regular and mundane schedule will help him stay in control and prevent him from harming anyone else. While is it very interesting to see him dealing with so much self-conflict, I hope this doesn't last for more than a few episodes because it could get boring.\n\nAs the viewer, we consistently hear Ellito's thoughts. However, if you separate out his thoughts and writing from the dialogue he has with other characters, it's amazing to realize how little he actually says. There's not too much to read into here, but it's easy to forget how secluded his character really is.\n\nEpisode 2\n--------------\nThe only way I can put it is that the show is getting very heavy, and I love it!\n\nElliot is completely psycho. Mr. Robot is more evil than I had expected. Angela is showing her dark side. I don't know what the deal is with Joanna Wellick, and I can't wait to have Tyrell come back already.\n\nI'm very impressed by the acting and the extremist characters being developed. The show is beginning to have a black mirror kind of feel, but delivered via a different medium.\n\nThe cinematography is also very interesting. The cut scenes are blunt and more evident than in other shows I've watched, but it accompanies the tone of the show very well. It shows that how abruptly things, such as life, could just end.\n\nEpisode 3\n--------------\nHoly fuck this show is amazing.\n\nA cold start that gives us an interesting, and very informative view of the past, that fits with the ending like cinderella's slipper. Followed by a fun and hopeful intro song, that transitions into Ellito's crazy and depressive view of life.\n\nElliot's performance is brilliant. The new characters are extremely interesting. I'm still drooling over the cut scenes and how they manage to interleave reality and fiction, which is only window into the root of Ellitot's frenzy.\n\nTrying to describe what this show is doing is leaving me speechless in a way that I've been searching for for a while now.\n\nEpisode 4\n-------------\nThis episode made really made me realize something important: TV shows and movies get progressively better when one is int he right mood. While I can't really compare my mood to Elliot's, this show has really widened my perspective of life and made me reflect on what I care about, what I want, what important to me, whom I care about, who cares about me, and much much more....\n\nSimultaneously, I'm amazed at how different and appropriate the music is with every episode. It varies so much, and it is the abrupt and very evident line that makes this show a pleasure and a surprise to watch. Similarly, the clash of tone between the different scenes is amazing as well. It jumps from Elliot in his mom's safe home, to a chess game in the park, to a meeting with a psychiatrist, or Darlene on the subway. The lighting and mood is extremely diverse, and is one of the reasons why I am so excited and captivated by every minute of the show.\n\nI also wanted to mention the cinematography again. In particular, I really like the distant horizontal landscape shot where Angela is standing and speaking to the boss of E corp. I've noticed this being used in better call saul on multiple occasions as well.\n\nEpisode 5\n------------\nAnother amazing episode. This show still had not had one filler episode. Every single one is extremely thrilling, interesting and critical to the plot.\n\nEpisode 6\n?????\n\nIt?s episodes like this that show how versatile the show is and make me love it. The first 10 minutes of the episode were very fun, quirky, original, messed up and divergent from the show?s theme introduction. It show that the producers are not afraid of exploring new angles and challenging the viewer?s expectations, which is simply awesome. \n\nI was very impressed by the use of silence and audio when Angela and Darlene were performing the hack. Having ver motivating and upbeat music as a background to an otherwise quite and unnerving atmosphere was a little weird, but abruptly cutting it when switching to Darlene took a direct stab at my anticipation and real made me feel for the character.\n\nWhile all of these interesting cinematography elements are incorporated into the show, we still get to see the main story progress, have the main characters be challenged and developed, AND even get a flashback for an origin story.\n\nThis show is absolutely amazing!\n\nEpisode 7\n????-\n\nAnother fantastic episode.\n\nOne thing I keep being impressed by in this show is how they manage to stay exciting, thrilling, interesting and unique every single episode. The number of storylines is big enough that we get some diversity, yet still small enough where we never have an episode where nothing really happens (I?m looking at you Game of Thrones).\n\nAngela?s character has plateued in terms of development, but now we?re seeing what she can as she?s becoming more comfortable in her new shell.\n\nI?m kind of curious what?s going to happen Tyrell. I question the fact that he is dead, and Joanna?s plotline has been being set up for some big event this whole season. This is been a huge mystery over the past 7 episodes and I really have no clue what to expect.\n\nRami Malek is simply brilliant. Playing a schizophrenic, a hacker, a depress mental patient, a beat up hostage, and so much more. The dynamics between him and Mr. Robot are so real that I sometimes forget I?m watching a show and forget what?s real and what?s not. In other times, I don?t know what?s real because Elliot himself lies to me!??Long story short, there is some explaining to do!\n\nEpisode 8\n?????\n\nTo show how elaborate and intriguing all the other plots int he show are, we got a full episode without Elliot and I didn?t even feel like anything was missing! I loved the backstory to how another serial killer (villain?) was born.\n\nEpisode 9\n---------------\nForgot to review this one...\n\nEpisode 10\n---------------\nI've said it once and I'll say it again: this show does not seize to amaze me.\n\nIt incorporates so many different story-telling, filming and communication elements that everyone of my senses is stimulated in a different way every single time.\n\nThe intro scene: the short monolog about being the strongest man in the room is something I could somewhat relate to so it really hit home. Having that be followed by screaming music was extremely unsettling but understandable.\n\nElliot's brilliance, confusion, and cluelessness is so truthful but scary at the same time that I don't know whether I want to hug him, help him or stop him.\n\nThe back and forth when Elliot was tracking where the phone call came from and Darlene was talking about how she was abducted as a kid was executed perfectly.\n\nBreaking the fourth wall and letting us look around Ellito's room was something I had never scene before. I felt like I was in a game. He prompted me to help him and I did my best. I'm fairly certain that there was a visible clue in there that I probably missed.\n\nAngela's plot thickens and I have no clue what to expect of her.\n\nI'm running out of words to use, as I wouldn't change anything about the last scene that was shot from afar. I got enough information to not feel like I was forgotten, but the sense of mystery regarding who died is very intriguing. \n\nBoth the shooting scene and Angela in the subway ended on a cliff hanger, but not one that I would dispute. It was made to be though provoking rather than irritating. It was perfect.\n\nEpisode 11\n--------------\nNot much to add here. \n\nThis episode was felt a little depressing when the FBI agent was lying in bed thinking about life. It got a little bit creepy when Angela was being questioned. And it was a little scary when Elliot was screaming in the cab towards the end.\n\nI'm really looking forward to seeing what's next.\n\nEpisode 12\n---------------\nAn amazing second season. There's nothing I can say that I haven't already said before because every single episode is top notch.\n\nI'm really glad Tyrell is back because I like the character and would like to see what's more to come from him. I also didn't realize I watched the last episode of the season. While there were cliff hangers, I didn't feel like it paused on a crescendo right before the ball was about to drop. The story has reached a series of milestones, and I have a lot to digest and think about until the show is back.", "hasReview": true}, "media": {"audienceScore": {"score": "90", "sentiment": "positive"}, "emsId": "cf9abd67-7c1f-3c07-8aed-b0f219d817a2", "pageLink": "/tv/mr_robot/s02", "posterUrl": "https://resizing.flixster.com/TCqjmpdI11L3Rh9On5yH9sY5Asg=/206x305/v2/https://flxt.tmsimg.com/assets/p12922738_b_v8_aa.jpg", "primaryVideo": {"exists": false, "emsId": "cf9abd67-7c1f-3c07-8aed-b0f219d817a2", "type": "TvSeason"}, "title": "Mr. Robot: Season 2", "tomatometerScore": {"certified": true, "score": "89", "sentiment": "positive"}, "type": "TvSeason"}}, {"createTime": 1466206690000, "review": {"score": 4.5, "review": "Episode 1\n-------------\nI'm intrigued. I like the sense of mystery and metaphysical connection being built between the different characters. I'm also a fan of having a large set of \"primary\" characters of diverse backgrounds because it gives the writers lots of options on how to develop the storyline and will keep things new fresh all the time. It's definitely hard to 'sense' how good the actual show will be, but the pilot was top notch. I'll give it 8/10 :p\n\nEpisode 2\n-------------\nSo far so good. I feel like there's a lot more to each character rather than just their superficial job/location/background. All the characters are connected on a deeper emotional level, and properly developing those connections is what's going to make or break this show. The mystery/fantasy aspect is very important as well because that's what gives it the uniqueness that keeps drawing me back in. This show has a very \"Lost\"-like feel to it, but I hope they don't disappoint the audience. I also loved the Bollywood piece.\n\nEpisode 3\n-------------\nAnother good episode but nothing to add.\n\nEpisodes 4, 5, 6\n----------------------\nI decided to marathon a few episodes one after the other due to my curiosity of how the story will progress. I must say that I\u0092m not disappointed a fair bit.\n\nThe mechanics of how the 8 are connected (sensing each other?) are original and refreshing. They can see each other, speak with one another, or otherwise go on meetings. Simultaneously, they can also share and harness each other skills and knowledge at times of need. They have trouble controlling and calling upon each other, but I expect that that\u0092ll get resolved eventually. They can keep their individual mind states, but are able to share their emotions and feelings. They can both love each other and be one another. Their is no fine line between how these individuals are connected, and I\u0092m not looking for one to be drawn.\n\nThe diversity of the characters selected is simply phenomenal. A wealthy Chinese woman, a poor bus driver from Kenya, a hacker transgender female from San Francisco, an American cop, a British druggie, a German thief, an (un)lucky Indian woman, and a gorgeous hispanic movie actor. I wouldn\u0092t have been able to come up with more diverse crew if I had to. This keeps storyline ever-changing and extremely captivating. Not a minute goes by that I don\u0092t experience some sort of emotion, be it happiness, sadness, excitement, intrigue, thrill or sympathy.\n\nThis also shows how the same ideas and themes we experience in life can be applicable in varying circumstances.\n\nReally looking forward to seeing how the characters keep learning about each other, how the individual plot lines converge, and simply what other surprises the show beholds.\n\nEpisode 7\n-------------\nThe first half of the episode is all rainbows, butterflied and compromise. It's all about love and the beauty in this world. You begin to think that things aren't so bad afterall. However, the second half takes a turn for the literal worst. Deaths in every scene. Dark, morbid, gruesome cold blooded death reminding us to never let our guard down.\n\nEpisodes 8\n---------------\nBackstory. Finally beginning to understand what's happening here.\n\nEpisode 9\n-------------\nSometimes you just need an episode of passion, sadness and sympathy to really reflect on life and connect with the characters. Like Lito's and Hernando's discussion, this episode was free, beautiful, art.\n\nEpisode 10\n---------------\nMost of the episode was blend and a great continuation to the intriguing story, but the last scene was breath taking. In an epic crescendo, we see the first breath of all the sensates. Overtaken by both happiness and sadness, we observe life in it's purest form. A very powerful and beautiful scene that I don't have words for.\n\nEpisode 11-12\n-------------------\nWow, what a finale.\n\nI love the drama and action. How close and interactively they all worked together, sharing each other's skills and thinking each other's thoughts. It was the dream team. It was a little higher tempo than some of the previous episodes, so aside from Riley, there was very little character development going on. It was moreso developed characters fulfilling their roles.\n\nI'm usually pretty content with show endings, even when they're not stelar, but this one felt week given how fantastic the rest of the season was. There are many plotlines half finished, many questions unanswered, and a lot more that can be done with this concept.\n\nI really hope a second season is in the works.", "hasReview": true}, "media": {"audienceScore": {"score": "90", "sentiment": "positive"}, "emsId": "55583114-5283-3f4a-b21a-cae694df1c35", "pageLink": "/tv/sense8/s01", "posterUrl": "https://resizing.flixster.com/d3c_dZcnIPEEsRTCB2_lnTtrjzk=/206x305/v2/https://resizing.flixster.com/FIEPZT5KGApq8ompw3n16Y7eDV8=/ems.cHJkLWVtcy1hc3NldHMvdHZzZWFzb24vUlRUVjE3NjQ0MS53ZWJw", "primaryVideo": {"exists": false, "emsId": "55583114-5283-3f4a-b21a-cae694df1c35", "type": "TvSeason"}, "title": "Sense8: Season 1", "tomatometerScore": {"certified": false, "score": "72", "sentiment": "positive"}, "type": "TvSeason"}}, {"createTime": 1463996877000, "review": {"score": 5, "review": "Episode 18: Another episode where John Oliver just bashes Trump all day long. While there are no surprises and every he says is indeed true, I would have been interested to hear his opinion on Peter Thiel's speech at the RPC. He was the only person with some sense, whom I also look up to, so John Oliver's analysis of what happened there would have been really interesting to me.\n\nEpisode 19: This episode should be called: \"A recap of the DNC and a reminder of why you shouldn't vote for trump.\" Similar to how one nail that stands out is painful to stand on but a thousand are not, there was too much good content to point out anything in particular.

While I do agree that crooked dealers taking advantage of people who need cars and don't have money, but who are the people making the purchase? Did they not do the math? If they have horrible credit, can they think twice about getting a car? Could they relocate their home to live closer to their job or find a job that's closer to home?

It\u0092s no secret that this was a setup episode that touched on and recapped many different stories without delving into any one in a ton of detail. Nonetheless, it was great and enjoyable.\n\nEpisode 2: Another great episode, but nothing particular to add. It's nice to see Bran again after it's been so long. I'm extremely glad John Snow is back. Can't believe what Remsey is doing...\n\nEpisode 3: Loving the new John Snow and the flashbacks. I'd like to point how amazing the cinematography is. It always looks right and appropriate, and is something I think the audience often takes for granted.\n\nEpisode 4\n-------------\nI finally got what I was looking for! \n\nI absolutely loved Daenerys's rebirth as she soon like a God in the burning flames. She has been mistreated and mistrusted the past little while, and I feel that at times even she lost faith in herself. However, we now see that she is as strong as ever. Tyrion's skillset is still undervalued as he is essentially governing the state while the Queen is gone. Little finger is finally back and seems to have a complete hold over the Vale. John snow and Sansa's reunion was extremely touching. This was an episode filled with both emotion adn power and moved a few plot lines very far along. \n\nEpisode 5\n-------------\n\nAmazing episode! Definitely the best episode of the season so far.\n\nI'm glad to see Aria's story progress a bit, but what we see is that she well never become a \"no one\". She will never forget her past, and she will never blindly follow orders. I'm curious to see where her plot line takes her.\n\nDaenerys and Jorah finally make up in what is a very confusing friend-friend, father-daughter, lover-lovedone relationship. This is a great opportunity for Tyrion to finally showcase his leadership skills. He is one of my favorite characters and I can't wait for him to get the credit he deserves.\n\nThe Greyjoys are finally trusting each other and taking action. I'm glad that Theon finally got his tonge back. Unfortunately there are some things he just won't be able to get back... \n\nThe last season was simply stunning. An action packed thrilling runaway scene, intertwined with the deaths of many characters (the tree dwellers, the old man who lives in the tree, Hodor...), that flips back and forth between the present and a flashback that tells us the story of how Hodor got his name along with the fate that awaited him all these years. So much in such a shorter scene, but it was so well done that I was left speechless.\n\nEpisode 6\n\u0097\u0097\u0097\u0097\u0097\u0097\u0097\nThe biggest question I have after watching this episode is where the hell is Aria\u0092s plot going to take her? What\u0092s her role going to be in the grander scheme of all of this?\n\nEpisode 7\n-------------\nJohn is slowly building an army building up the anticipating for the battle ahead. Arya looks like she's about to die. The hound's anger keeps accumulates furthermore even as he tries to find peace. Jaime is being a boss, and Margeary has a plan. Just another typical episode of Game of Thrones.\n\nEpisode 8\n-------------\nThe hound is transforming, in a good way. I think there is an imminent reunion between him an Arya in the very near future. Speaking of Arya, it was a great sense of relief to see that she has been able to escape the many faced gods and will be able to return, stronger and faster, to her home. As always, Tyrion doesn't let me down and keeps kicking ass; in a metaphorical sense.\n\nEpisode 9\n-------------\nAs always, the second last episode of the season does not disappoint. An epic display of power by Daenerys. An eloquent message from Tyrion. An unbelievably amazing fight scene against the boltons that made me feel like I'm really there, on the battle field! I have no words to describe how realistic this felt. A phenomenal performance act of swordsmanship, courage and stupidity by John Snow. A lovely surprise from Sansa, and proof that she's not just giving in to the men around her, but is smarter than most people think. She literally saved the day! It was sad to see the wildling giant die, but for Rickon I had less compassion since I barely knew him. The giant, on numerous occasions was a huge contributor to victory and he will not be forgotten. Can't say I was upset that the hounds did not go hungry :)\n\nI think everyone, and I mean absolutely everyone, can agree that this episode was unreal.\n\nEpisode 10\n---------------\nMan, what an amazing episode. \n\nI think this is the best season finale the series has had so far. The second last episode was always very climactic, but the season finales usually just tied up a few loose ends. This one did indeed tie up some loose ends as well, but in a much more grandiose manner.\n\nCersei just blew everyone up, and I would not have seen that from a million miles away. It was so exciting! The faith is entirely gone, and only the crown is left to rule. The music and tone accompanying this turn of events was very quite, relaxing, but not gloomy at all so it was hard to anticipate what was going to happen. The computer graphics, and the way the kid lured a member of the faith to the underground chambers was perfect. Everything progressed at a very good pace and the finale did not disappoint. I also can't believe Toman was so broken by the explosion that he decided to take his own lice. Cersei and Jamie have nothing to live for anymore, so I can't really tell where their story is going to progress. The Lannisters and Baratheon no longer have any throne (though I guess Jamie is still young enough to marry), and the opposing forces, with much more rightful kings and queens are on their way with very strong armies. \n\nDaenerys and Tyrion are doing their thing while developing a close relationship. I'm glad they're finally on a ship and ready to sail to the 7 kingdoms.\n\nJohn Snow. John Stark? John Targaryen? A man who dwindles in both and ice. The king of the North. The keeper of the wall? An all around general badass. He's finally getting the respect he deserves. My only concern is why Sansa wasn't happy when she saw him getting support from everyone else. After all, she herself said that she sees him as a Stark, but did her mind change? Did she imagine herself by Littlefinger's side sitting on the iron throne? I really hope they don't turn on each other.\n\n\n\nAmazing season that far exceeded any expectations I had, which were pretty high to start with.", "hasReview": true}, "media": {"audienceScore": {"score": "93", "sentiment": "positive"}, "emsId": "1e1c25ea-588d-3b9b-b2ae-848025eb7bd2", "pageLink": "/tv/game_of_thrones/s06", "posterUrl": "https://resizing.flixster.com/fCUjT3wrcwWZMlEZXXEf3flC-yU=/206x305/v2/https://flxt.tmsimg.com/assets/p12502846_b_v8_aa.jpg", "primaryVideo": {"exists": false, "emsId": "1e1c25ea-588d-3b9b-b2ae-848025eb7bd2", "type": "TvSeason"}, "title": "Game of Thrones: Season 6", "tomatometerScore": {"certified": true, "score": "94", "sentiment": "positive"}, "type": "TvSeason"}}, {"createTime": 1461574937000, "review": {"score": 4.5, "review": "Episode 1\n-------------\nIt\u0092s back with the same characters, stories and humor. Satirical jokes that developers can relate to but are funny to everyone.

I could not constrain my laughter throughout. While a lot of what happens is quite exaggerated, the fact that there is a seed of reality is what makes it. The recruiting bit in particular was on point.\n\nEpisode 4\n--------------\nWhile I do love the reality of this show, it has started to fade in favor of more exciting absurd situations. The company no longer has a CEO!? Bighead magically got $20MM and started an incubator. The characters are as entertaining as funny as always and I just can't wait to see how everything plays out. It's also worth mentioning that the show probably tries to appeal to the envy of a lot of developers by portraying the Piper Piper team as a bunch that just \"can't do a bad job\" when they were building the box.\n\nEpisode 5\n-------------\nWhile not one of the best episodes of the season, it was definitely an emotional rollercoaster. Richard embarrasses himself and gives up and almost loses his CEO position, and to get a better story from big head so that his is spiked. Almost all of PiedPiper\u0092s IP gets released into the public, only for Gilfoyle to be a badass and show everyone how it\u0092s done.\n\nEpisode 6\n-------------\nIt was cool to see Alcatraz on the show given that I was there only a week; it shows how close the show is to home. I'm glad Big Head is going bankrupt because I felt like there was an undertone expressing that $20 MM is an endless amount of money, but given how Erlich was wasting it, it couldn't have lasted that long. I'm pretty upset that Richard fucked it up with the girl from Facebook, but it was otherwise not their strongest episode this season.\n\nEpisode 7\n-------------\nI feel a sense of sympathy for Erlich, a sense of respect for Gilfoyle, a sense of sadness for Big Head, and a sense of excitement for Richard. You could say it was an emotional episode.\n\nEpisode 8\n-------------\nFantastic episode! Loved seeing Richard in a very realistic newscast. I feel extremely bad for Erlich, as well as Ronald Wayne (ex-owner of 10% of Apple), after doing some follow-up research. Also, as a Twitter employee, there was a sense of excitement seeing Dick Costolo in the show where I know that his background in comedy and tech probably blend very well.\n\nEpisode 10\n---------------\nA great way to finish off the season. I love the sense of realism in the show, ranging from uber, to food, to the importance of users, etc... Very financially accurate as well in regard to all the dealings associated with sock.\n\nOverall, I'm really excited about how things ended, with Bachmanity buying the company and a new company structure to look forward to next year. :) Man, what an emotional rollecoaster though.", "hasReview": true}, "media": {"audienceScore": {"score": "94", "sentiment": "positive"}, "emsId": "808cbe88-3d15-3023-9df1-4bfeea14ff57", "pageLink": "/tv/silicon_valley/s03", "posterUrl": "https://resizing.flixster.com/hcAd9Kwl39mqO4Wl2Lgh_CJMljA=/206x305/v2/https://resizing.flixster.com/-Q3i5Fn4LEqLuQfio-FPunJ1H7I=/ems.cHJkLWVtcy1hc3NldHMvdHZzZWFzb24vUlRUVjIwMjA4OC53ZWJw", "primaryVideo": {"exists": false, "emsId": "808cbe88-3d15-3023-9df1-4bfeea14ff57", "type": "TvSeason"}, "title": "Silicon Valley: Season 3", "tomatometerScore": {"certified": true, "score": "100", "sentiment": "positive"}, "type": "TvSeason"}}, {"createTime": 1460537558000, "review": {"score": 4, "review": "Amongst the lines of other shows such ass Modern Family or Community, Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt was a new and refreshing change.

My roommates and I originally started watching this show because the premise was enticing. We quickly realised that it's just a cheesy teen drama with a bunch of really good looking people. However, we kept watching it out of sheer amusement and were impressed some of the plot twists and the transformations some of the characters had undergone.\n\nWith the first episode of season 3, the show is on point! It was the cheesy show we all over but revamped with characters who have transformed and found their new place. Jasper can't get over his girlfriend and has become a gloomy psycho. Bellamy has a lot of new and interested responsibilities. Octavia and her boyfriend are what one would call \"complicated\". Most importantly, our hero Clarke is crazier and wilder than ever. Adventurous and sexy, she is probably what draws such a large audience to this show. \n\nMost importantly, there are several different interest plot lines happening simultaneously, and I'm curious to see how they will expand and then converge. In particular, I am very interested to learn more about Jaha and the city of light.\n\nEpisode 2\n-------------\n\nIt's more of the same thing as Episode 1, which is exactly what I was hoping and anticipating!\n\nI'm quite impressed by how many plot lines, characters, and story development the writers have been packing in recently; it never feels like a dull moment on the 100.\n\nThe Sky Crew find their other half, where Monty reunites with his mom and learns their story. Clark has been brought back to the beautiful, lovely, yet betraying queen of the Tree Crew. Jasper still can't get over Maya, and I have no crew where the city of lights plotline is moving.\n\nThere aren't a lot of shows that get more and more exciting with every episode, but somehow the 100 did it.\n\nEpisode 3\n-------------\n\nThis season is still not slowing down!\n\nSome characters are deceiving, others are straight out lying, and our beloved Clark can't keep her emotions or mindset stable for longer than 5 minutes.\n\nAlmost all of the residents of the second half of the arch were blown away along with mount weather. Sky crew joined tree crew as a clan in their tribe, and the ice nation declared war.\n\nI'm amazed at the high pace that all the content is coming, as this is quickly turning into one of my favorite shows.\n\nEpisode 4\n-------------\nJasper and Monti discuss what they've gone through, the commander of the thirteen colonies proves that she deserves her seat, skycrew is planning to defy their alliance, and Clark is just being her usual self.\n\nAn entertaining episode with a very Game of Thrones like feel. I feel that the actors who were once just cheesy, have really grown, turning this into a serious post-apocaliptic show.\n\nEpisode 5\n-------------\nI'm continually impressed by how much this show, and the characters in it have grown since the first episode. It is no longer a cliche teen drama, it is an original futuristic post-apocalyptic story of love, hate, war, peace and passion with a very intricate backstory that has been slowly unfolding. It is beginning to remind of Fringe. Fringe originally had CSI type episodes where every episode had a start, a mystery, a resolution, an end and closure. Eventually however, Fringe turned into something much more complex and beautiful where the final season was one of the best seasons in sci-fi television. While The 100 is still not close to that on many standards, I'm beginning to feel that path that lies ahead will be very interesting.\n\nI love that this episode gave us a backstory on the AI. It's something I've been looking forward to for a very long time.\n\nEpisodes 6 - 8: Seems like rotten tomatoes didn\u0092t save my reviews of these episodes\u0085\n\nEpisodes 9 - 12\n----------------------\nI\u0092ll be honest, my roommate and I went on a bit of a spree and watch two episodes two days in a row. All I have to say is WOW! No longer are we just watching a group of kids (who were selected not only for their talents but also their looks), but we are watching a story unfold. It is a battle of survival, betrayal, protection, history, religion, and the future of human kind rests on the shoulders of a group of individuals who not too long ago knew of nothing but a ship in space.\n\nEach of the four episodes had a different tone to it, but overall, the show got a lot more scary, thrilling, bloody and real. The 100 seems to have taken a couple lessons from Game of Thrones and realized that primary characters/individuals do die in war, and it brings a real sense of realism when a TV show is not afraid of killing them as well. Some notable names: Lexa, Lincoln, Sinclair, the Flamekeeper and all the kids who were also candidates for being the new commander. Speaking of lessons from GoT, I did not expect the current (fake) commander to gorge out the eyeballs of the man who was questioning her lead; it really took me by surprise.\n\nThese four episodes have moved very fast. Pike went from leading all of Skicrew to being handed over to the grounders. The rest of the ark has been taken over by A.L.I.E. We\u0092re finally learning the purpose of the AI and the backstory to how the world ended and how it was meant to be saved. The last member of Mount Weather came in, nearly killed everyone, and then taken care of by our heroic Clarke. Murphy is becoming increasingly appealing as I\u0092m beginning to appreciate how slick and smart he really is. He really has been defining his own path, and literally has no one on his side. He is a lone wolf who is maturing and will be worth fearing.\n\nWithout getting into more details, I can only say that the show has grown a lot. The directors, writers and actors who make this show have come a long way since the first episode of the first season, and I can\u0092t wait to see what happens next.\n\nEpisode 13\n---------------\nAt this point I'm not sure how dark this show can get. I can't believe Kane was crucified but did expect that he'd be forced into taking one of the chips. Not really loving the conflict between Octavia and Bellamie, but do understand that it's not something they can simply downplay and forget. I am really excited that we have finally met Luna, who lives on an oil platform somewhere in the ocean!\n\nAs much as I do love flashbacks, the one in this episode had a hard time mixing in with the theme of the episode. There were some connections, but did feel a little forced given the context of the events happening. For example: Octactiva is making a fire, so we \"must\" have a flashback to show how Pike taught her to make a fire. A little too cliche for my flavor.\n\nEpisode 14\n--------------\nA few things stood out in this episode.\n\nFirstly, luna is a badass. We will definitely be seeing her again and I'm curious what other skills she has up her sleeves.\n\nSecondly, Raven is a boss. The tech terminology they use in the show is kind of impressive given that I thought they'd put zero effort into it. I love seeing her and monty trying to hack into A.L.I.E using backdoors and seeing what'll happen.\n\nThirdly, good job Monty! So glad my boy is getting some.\n\nFourthly, I think I finally figured out how A.L.I.E works. The first version of the AI is able to do a full scan of an individual's neurological state after they take the chip. This essentially captures an individuals thoughts, memories, characteristics and identity. Therefore, even after the individual dies, everything they are keeps living in the city of light in the digital form for eternity; or at least until ALIE is destroyed.\n\nLastly, I absolutely loved the last scene where everyone looked at Clarke when they were looking to someone to decide what to do next. This shows that even though Clarke let them down on multiple occasions, they still look to her for guidance and leadership when times are desperate.\n\nEpisode 15\n\u0097\u0097\u0097\u0097\u0097\u0097\nEveryone is dying. Literally, everyone is dying.\n\nI\u0092m unsure whether these are budget cuts or if the writers are simply trying to set a \u0091realistic\u0092 post-apocalyptic scene. Regardless, it\u0092s exciting and invigorating and I can\u0092t wait to keep watching.\n\nThere was a very quick and organic transition from the battle between the various clans (tree crew, sky crew, ice nation, etc\u0085) to everyone verses A.L.I.E. I\u0092m impressed by how slow and natural this felt, and does feel real all things provided.\n\nMy only guess as to what can happen next is that Luna will appear out of nowhere, take the chip for the new A.I., and we will somehow save the day. There will be more casualties along the way, and we may lose some big characters, but it\u0092s hard to predict the details.\n\nLast episode\n-----------------\nIt's difficult to write a thrilling, entertaining, partially unexpected ending that's completely satisfying but still leaves the potential for more. That being said, season 3 of the 100 did it. \n\nThe final episode was action packed, forcing all the characters to really show their true colors and make difficult decisions. The ending, in my opinion, was the best move they could have made. It wasn't a sappy / cheesy and happy ending, but nor did everything go to shit. It was the perfect balance of reality fiction that's not making me itch for more but still look forward to the next season.", "hasReview": true}, "media": {"audienceScore": {"score": "59", "sentiment": "negative"}, "emsId": "53e7624e-fb73-3b46-b436-61297fc10df7", "pageLink": "/tv/the_100/s03", "posterUrl": "https://resizing.flixster.com/8NVefTwhP0QqJzH3wlHJ6BWiAn0=/206x305/v2/https://flxt.tmsimg.com/assets/p12382881_b_v8_aa.jpg", "primaryVideo": {"exists": false, "emsId": "53e7624e-fb73-3b46-b436-61297fc10df7", "type": "TvSeason"}, "title": "The 100: Season 3", "tomatometerScore": {"certified": false, "score": "83", "sentiment": "positive"}, "type": "TvSeason"}}, {"createTime": 1450024383000, "review": {"score": 4, "review": "Episode 1\n-------------\n\nLong time freddiew & rocketjump fan, so I'm really really glad they're doing this.

Daryl has softened up and open his arms. Carol just freaks me out. That old character came back. He is a mysterious being whom I want to learn more about. Everyone has identified their role. Everyone\u0092s characters have been molded and shaped into who they are not. Now it\u0092s just time to execute, move on and survive. The show has had a lot of character development over the past couple seasons, and I\u0092m beginning to want to see some closure.\n\nOn a side note, I love it when directors can to play around and experiment with different styles of shooting. The black & white / color switches were a pleasant change and made the episode very easy to follow.\n\nEpisode 2\n--------------\n\nVery dark. Very gorry. This is why I love the walking dead. It showed everyone's true nature and ability to overcome obstacles and survive. It was also an easy way to kill of all the extra characters that were added in via Alexandria.\n\nEpisode 3\n--------------\n\nA pretty slow and boring episode for the most part with a very clear message: Anyone can get left behind if there is no other choice. Not very exciting until the very end where the writers surprised me by killing off a character I thought was untouchable.\n\nEpisode 4\n--------------\n\nAs much as I do love origin stories, this one was very one sided. It must've been a year or two since they last saw each other, and so much could have happened. The whole story was surrounded around one particular set of events and could have expanded into so much more. While parts of it were definitely interesting and intriguing, I was hoping for more...\n\nEpisodes 5 - 8\n-------------------\n\nThe Walking Dead did it again with Glen's return. I just couldn't believe it. Other than that though, nothing much has happened. I get it, everyone is said and scared. Everyone wants a better future and doesn't know how to get there, but we've seen this before and the only thing that has changed are the supporting roles. It was nonetheless entertaining and I hope that what feels like a build up won't let me down.\n\nOh yea, that tower fell, I wonder what will happen next.\n\nEpisode 9\n-------------\n\nProbably one of my favorite episodes to my recent recollection of the show. I loved the thrill, the suspense, and the action. So many of our favorite characters were on the edge of getting killed in some way but managed to dodge a bullet (both literally and figuratively) last second. The show killed of some of the minor characters whose story I didn't really see going anywhere, and for that I am grateful. I also loved the cinematography and vibrant explosions; not something we typically see on The Walking Dead. Overall, this episode was simply amazing!\n\nEpisode 10\n---------------\nTwo consecutive episodes couldn't be any more different. While episode 9 was filled with anxiety, thrill and danger, episode 10 was filled with self-reflection, trickery, and character development. Everyone goes through hard times and looks for different ways to express their emotions; both through friendship and love. Rick and Daryl are bros. It's amazing how close they've grown over the years. Carl lost an eye, but he's still a helpless teen trying to figure out his place in a helpless world. Throughout the episode I questioned if something could happen between Rick and Michonne, and I was not disappointed. I also can't wait to learn more about this Jesus guy!\n\nEpisode 11\n---------------\nGreat episode. Rather than settling in a place, trying to protect it, and then move on, we finally see some original ideas! Multiple camps, different types of communities, trades. As Abraham, who is going through some changes, said, it's a Brave New World!\n\nEpisode 12\n---------------\nA dark, thrilling, action-filled episode with a twist at the end! I love what all the characters have morphed into over the years and can't wait to see what happens next!\n\nEpisode 9\n-------------\n \u0093Don\u0092t think. Just eat\u0094. A slow episode that finally addresses both physical and mental tolls that a the life of the walking dead can take. From hunger, to anger, and sadness, and replete with lethargy, the limitations of a real human being are finally addressed; emotionally and physically. The crew grows pessimistic, but manages to hold on to hope by a thin thread. As always though, there are some surprises.\n\nEpisode 10\n---------------\n The moment I finally realized that the writers intentionally inject specific statements to misrepresent the the plot of the next episode. Slow episode where nothing really happened only built to portray Rick's lacks of ability to trust anyone else in this world. Alluding to something or just paranoid? That is the question.\n\nEpisode 11\n---------------\nI'm beginning to wonder who the bad guys are.\n\nEpisode 12\n----------------\nA very well directed episode that manages to make Alexandria feel too safe, even for the audience. The new conditions, and scenes we would not traditionally expect from the walking dead make you let your guard down, only to bring you closer to the characters in the show and make you feel as though the ambience safety is artificial.\n\nEpisode 13\n----------------\nAnother great episode from the series in a suprisingly great season. We see that no matter how strong you've become, killing other people is never easy. While I also do love our main heroes, it's becoming increasingly difficult to distinguish between who the good and bad guys are.\n\nEpisode 14: \n---------------\nEugene has brilliant ideas and grows as a character. Carol can't handle what she's has to do and left, but I expect her to come back. Sasha and Abraham are finally getting it on. Daryl has grown from a badass to a super badass. The writing, character growth and plot twists are absolutely amazing.\n\nOne thing I love about this show is that, weirdly, a show. Zombie movies can only go into so much depth and show so much story. The transformation of the main team, the members themselves and the members its composed of, was very gradual and natural. Seeing someone go from a normal world to a killer in 2 hours would seem unbelievable, but I was able to experience every single step that these characters had to endure. I am no longer sure whether they're good or bad, righteous or evil, but I know that they've always had to do what they need to survive. They care about each other, and that shows compassion. They kill others out of their love for each other, as much as they might hate it. I feel like I've made a bond with them and am part of their family.\n\nEpisode 15\n---------------\nOne of the slower episodes of the season that keeps reaffirming the types of personalities our characters have grown into. The taciturn Carol is a born killer. The steadfast Rick just keeps on charging. The seemingly unemotional Daryl can\u0092t withhold his emotions. The ending literally made me gasp and jump out of my seat.\n\nEpisode 16\n---------------\n\nHoly Fuck.", "hasReview": true}, "media": {"audienceScore": {"score": "79", "sentiment": "positive"}, "emsId": "f02181af-697f-348a-887f-c15a590bbf5d", "pageLink": "/tv/the_walking_dead/s06", "posterUrl": "https://resizing.flixster.com/8uHOJZYQI8DppJJmMGKunW27BgI=/206x305/v2/https://flxt.tmsimg.com/assets/p12025282_b_v8_aa.jpg", "primaryVideo": {"exists": false, "emsId": "f02181af-697f-348a-887f-c15a590bbf5d", "type": "TvSeason"}, "title": "The Walking Dead: Season 6", "tomatometerScore": {"certified": true, "score": "76", "sentiment": "positive"}, "type": "TvSeason"}}, {"createTime": 1447192482000, "review": {"score": 4.5, "review": "Episode 1\n-------------\nIt is difficult to judge the quality of the film and story as I'm just really pleased to see this show again after almost a year and half of finishing season 1. More of the same dark drawing tone and mysterious characters. The actual shots filmed seem to be of higher quality, so the budget may have very well increased.\n\nEpisode 2\n-------------\nThere is a very unsettling feeling watching parts of this show, which is precisely why I love it. That being said, I would really like to know what the hell is going on. The show keeps raising more questions, and the promises of answers keep lining up. I'm beginning to fear that all the mysteries will make their way to the abyss and answers will never be provided but I have hope!\n\nEpisode 3\n-------------\nWhile I can't say I did not enjoy this episode, it definitely wasn't one of their better ones. The show is moving way too slowly. I get it, the kid just likes staring at everyone. The mother doesn't like her child. The child is important. No one knows what's happening. Let's move on. A slow build up is important and interesting, but only if there is a payoff, and I want to be alive (no pun intended) for when that happens. \n\nI'm curious to know what they'll find in the deep excavation. Answers perhaps?\n\nI'm also not a fan of Milan. It kind of feels like there will be a lot of conflict surrounding him, which just seems like a distraction from the main plot. Everyone has unresolved problems, and he seems to be the centre of them, but the whole city could not have returned just to deal with him.\n\nEpisode 4\n-------------\nThings are just getting creepier and creepier, and I'm not sure whether the show is approaching a resolution or delving deeper into what seems a well of infinite depth.\n\nThe dead have some sort of mind-reading powers.

Just eat\u0094. A slow episode that finally addresses both physical and mental tolls that a the life of the walking dead can take. From hunger, to anger, and sadness, and replete with lethargy, the limitations of a real human being are finally addressed; emotionally and physically. The crew grows pessimistic, but manages to hold on to hope by a thin thread. As always though, there are some surprises.\n\nEpisode 10: The moment I finally realized that the writers intentionally inject specific statements to misrepresent the the plot of the next episode. Slow episode where nothing really happened only built to portray Rick's lacks of ability to trust anyone else in this world. Alluding to something or just paranoid? That is the question.\n\nEpisode 11: I'm beginning to wonder who the bad guys are.\n\nEpisode 12: A very well directed episode that manages to make Alexandria feel too safe, even for the audience. The new conditions, and scenes we would not traditionally expect from the walking dead make you let your guard down, only to bring you closer to the characters in the show and make you feel as though the ambience safety is artificial.\n\nEpisode 14: Another great episode from the series in a suprisingly great season. We see that no matter how strong you've become, killing other people is never easy. While I also do love our main heroes, it's becoming increasingly difficult to distinguish between who the good and bad guys are.\n\nEpisode 15: Eugene has brilliant ideas and grows as a character. Carol can't handle what she's has to do and left, but I expect her to come back. Sasha and Abraham are finally getting it on. Daryl has grown from a badass to a super badass. The writing, character growth and plot twists are absolutely amazing.\n\nOne thing I love about this show is that, weirdly, a show. Zombie movies can only go into so much depth and show so much story. The transformation of the main team, the members themselves and the members its composed of, was very gradual and natural. Seeing someone go from a normal world to a killer in 2 hours would seem unbelievable, but I was able to experience every single step that these characters had to endure. I am no longer sure whether they're good or bad, righteous or evil, but I know that they've always had to do what they need to survive. They care about each other, and that shows compassion. They kill others out of their love for each other, as much as they might hate it. I feel like I've made a bond with them and am part of their family.", "hasReview": true}, "media": {"audienceScore": {"score": "88", "sentiment": "positive"}, "emsId": "5d7b6590-1ec0-33a2-9c48-ccf87a9650e4", "pageLink": "/tv/the_walking_dead/s05", "posterUrl": "https://resizing.flixster.com/zM3JnXFIzIGAZ-rsyylpZ6c3_VA=/206x305/v2/https://flxt.tmsimg.com/assets/p10492707_b_v8_aa.jpg", "primaryVideo": {"exists": false, "emsId": "5d7b6590-1ec0-33a2-9c48-ccf87a9650e4", "type": "TvSeason"}, "title": "The Walking Dead: Season 5", "tomatometerScore": {"certified": true, "score": "90", "sentiment": "positive"}, "type": "TvSeason"}}, {"createTime": 1411034267000, "review": {"score": 5, "hasReview": false}, "media": {"audienceScore": {"score": "96", "sentiment": "positive"}, "emsId": "d79700d4-fd92-3bee-8301-1979e0fb1a41", "pageLink": "/tv/house-of-cards/s02", "posterUrl": "https://resizing.flixster.com/2vOiS-Wg8Eypty7a5FGjPC6lvsE=/206x305/v2/https://flxt.tmsimg.com/assets/p10398407_b_v8_aa.jpg", "primaryVideo": {"exists": false, "emsId": "d79700d4-fd92-3bee-8301-1979e0fb1a41", "type": "TvSeason"}, "title": "House of Cards: Season 2", "tomatometerScore": {"certified": true, "score": "83", "sentiment": "positive"}, "type": "TvSeason"}}, {"createTime": 1411034254000, "review": {"score": 4, "hasReview": false}, "media": {"audienceScore": {"score": "83", "sentiment": "positive"}, "emsId": "75915a8b-a8c5-3dd4-a66b-670edf3c7fd9", "pageLink": "/tv/arrow/s01", "posterUrl": "https://resizing.flixster.com/krcEaxLAHYAFd9AJP4Hbp5kmwpY=/206x305/v2/https://resizing.flixster.com/VWriBFK_XAiDbjxYJcJQvf4tHZE=/ems.cHJkLWVtcy1hc3NldHMvdHZzZWFzb24vUlRUVjY0MzQ3LndlYnA=", "primaryVideo": {"exists": false, "emsId": "75915a8b-a8c5-3dd4-a66b-670edf3c7fd9", "type": "TvSeason"}, "title": "Arrow: Season 1", "tomatometerScore": {"certified": true, "score": "85", "sentiment": "positive"}, "type": "TvSeason"}}, {"createTime": 1411034248000, "review": {"score": 4, "hasReview": false}, "media": {"audienceScore": {"score": "87", "sentiment": "positive"}, "emsId": "38aa42d6-db66-39cc-b860-eea37ea3b553", "pageLink": "/tv/arrow/s02", "posterUrl": "https://resizing.flixster.com/qnio1eUCVgfnf2krTUO6PqKXkuQ=/206x305/v2/https://resizing.flixster.com/XGPVC5QCoeqt_fY95IKBJ5Z9TaI=/ems.cHJkLWVtcy1hc3NldHMvdHZzZWFzb24vUlRUVjEzMDU3MC53ZWJw", "primaryVideo": {"exists": false, "emsId": "38aa42d6-db66-39cc-b860-eea37ea3b553", "type": "TvSeason"}, "title": "Arrow: Season 2", "tomatometerScore": {"certified": true, "score": "95", "sentiment": "positive"}, "type": "TvSeason"}}, {"createTime": 1411034231000, "review": {"score": 4, "hasReview": false}, "media": {"audienceScore": {"score": "69", "sentiment": "positive"}, "emsId": "d0af2c6a-5d93-3d00-926e-135588eb819d", "pageLink": "/tv/arrow/s03", "posterUrl": "https://resizing.flixster.com/cepA231YnDpSWGWFPrezQ7UKjNI=/206x305/v2/https://flxt.tmsimg.com/assets/p10874280_b_v8_aa.jpg", "primaryVideo": {"exists": false, "emsId": "d0af2c6a-5d93-3d00-926e-135588eb819d", "type": "TvSeason"}, "title": "Arrow: Season 3", "tomatometerScore": {"certified": true, "score": "89", "sentiment": "positive"}, "type": "TvSeason"}}, {"createTime": 1409413519000, "review": {"score": 5, "review": "The state of the show mimics it's own plot, which is just a depiction of our understanding of the world around us.
